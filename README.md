# InstaTrueReel

**Immersive True 9:16 Reel Experience** — makes Instagram Reels play TikTok-style:
full-bleed edge-to-edge video under a transparent status bar, transparent nav bar,
floating UI. Built entirely with GitHub Actions (decompile → smali patch → rebuild → sign).

## 📦 Downloads

| Release | APK | What |
|---|---|---|
| [v0.10.1-phase9.1](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.10.1-phase9.1) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **THE BLACK-SCREEN FIX**: the v0.10 field log proved the overlay architecture was right but the adoption itself always threw `IllegalStateException: child already has a parent` (A2H called `addView` without `removeView` first — 22 failed adoptions in one log), so the video stayed behind the opaque overlay: black screen + audio. v0.10.1 detaches the video before adopting (and before restoring on exit), adds a 600ms adoption sanity clock that self-heals back to portrait if the surface never materializes, fixes the INVERTED page-change debounce guard (it could only confirm during layout bursts, never on the steady tick), and gates the v0.7 portrait layout-surgery passes while the overlay player is active (they churned the tree behind the overlay) |
| [v0.10.0-phase9](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.10.0-phase9) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **THE OVERLAY PLAYER**: the real TikTok landscape fullscreen. Tapping "Full screen" now ADOPTS the video TextureView into our own decor-level overlay (the Groot `SurfaceTextureListener` re-binds it, so playback continues) — video edge-to-edge, top info bar (back + title), center play/pause, bottom action row (like/comment/share), all portrait chrome hidden. Swipe-to-next swaps the video (or cleanly exits for portrait reels) — the v0.9.1 spurious auto-exits are gone (page changes are detected by video identity now). **Also fixes the Android 16+ startup crash** (a bad `android/lang/Object` reference in helper A1E that Android 16's verifier hard-rejects) |
| [v0.9.1-phase8.1](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.9.1-phase8.1) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **THE ROTATION-FIGHT FIX**: the v0.9 field log proved Instagram actively fights landscape — `BaseFragmentActivity.A1p` re-asserts PORTRAIT on every config-change delivery via `0XU → 0XX → 6mW` (FixedOrientationCompat), and the rotation's config change flaps the clips fragment lifecycle, firing our restore mid-rotation. v0.9.1 gates `6mW.A00` (every app-side orientation set is swallowed while fullscreen is engaged), adds a 1500ms transient-rotation guard to the restore path, and auto-exits landscape when you swipe to a portrait reel (TikTok behavior) |
| [v0.9.0-phase8](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.9.0-phase8) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **TikTok-style horizontal fullscreen** — a "Full screen" pill appears under landscape videos in any Reels entry; tap it to rotate the app into an edge-to-edge landscape player (comment strip hidden, "x" exit top-left). Broken: the rotation was fought back by Instagram's portrait-lock (fixed in v0.9.1) |
| [v0.8.0-phase7](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.8.0-phase7) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **Strip-overlay transformation — THE comment-bar fix**: the v0.7 strip dump proved the comment bar is a sibling strip INSIDE the fragment root (below the fragment view, unreachable by ancestor walks); v0.8 extends the video child to full height (weight zeroed) and floats the strip over it with cleared backgrounds — TikTok-style fullscreen video with the pill floating at the bottom |
| [v0.7.0-phase6](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.7.0-phase6) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **Bottom-gap closure + strip telemetry**: attacks the last opaque area (comment-bar strip) with exact-height surgery on short containers; names any remaining culprit view in a tiny log |
| [v0.6.0-phase5](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.6.0-phase5) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **Chain liberation — STATUS BAR FIXED ON EVERY ENTRY POINT** (home-feed overlay, Watch History, Likes, Reels tab); full logcat diagnostics |
| [v0.5.0-phase4](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.5.0-phase4) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **Full-bleed bottom + modal path attempt**: transparent main tab bar (2ZS/0bQ/0bI) + runtime view-id de-block (turned out to be a silent no-op — fixed in v0.6) |
| [v0.4.0-phase3](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.4.0-phase3) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **TikTok-style overlays**: v0.3 + top-bar scrim 0.6 → 0.2 alpha + fully transparent bottom comment bar |
| [v0.3.0-phase2](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.3.0-phase2) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | **Native edge-to-edge**: forces Instagram's own immersive Reels mode on (`9Wz.EEr → true`) + status/nav-bar interceptors |
| [v0.2.0-phase1.1](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.2.0-phase1.1) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | Window-chrome interceptors only (superseded) |
| [v0.1.0-phase1](https://github.com/skyro777/InstaTrueReel/releases/tag/v0.1.0-phase1) | `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-InstaTrueReel-signed.apk` | Initial attempt (superseded) |

- **v0.10.1 (phase 9.1): the black-screen fix** — the overlay now actually SHOWS the video: A2H detaches the TextureView from its original parent before re-parenting it into the overlay (the missing `removeView` made every adoption throw), A2J detaches from the overlay before restoring on exit, a `fsAdoptAt` sanity clock bails back to portrait if adoption fails within ~600ms (no more eternal black screens), the page-change debounce guard is un-inverted (swipes are detected reliably now, not only during layout bursts), and the v0.7 portrait surgery passes are suspended while the overlay player is up (no more tree churn feeding the detector).
- **v0.10.0 (phase 9): the overlay player** — tap "Full screen" on a landscape reel: the video itself is moved into a fullscreen overlay player we fully control (TikTok-style top bar, center pause, bottom action row); taps/swipes pass through to Instagram's real gesture pipeline, so tap-to-pause, double-tap-to-like and swipe-to-page all keep working natively. Fixes the Android 16 crash.
- **v0.9.1 (phase 8.1): the rotation-fight fix** — tap "Full screen" and the app now STAYS landscape: Instagram's reactive portrait-lock (`FixedOrientationCompat`) is gated while fullscreen is engaged; the rotation's own lifecycle flap no longer tears the state down; swipe to a portrait reel and it returns to portrait automatically.

### Install (IMPORTANT — read fully)

1. **Fully uninstall** your current Instagram first. This includes:
   - any InstaTrueReel build (v0.1/v0.2),
   - the base Piko APK (`Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-patches-v3.8.0.apk`),
   - any other modded Instagram.
   Android **silently refuses** to install an APK over an app signed with a different key —
   the installer says "App not installed" and the OLD app keeps running. This is the #1
   reason people see "no change": the old APK was still the one running.
2. Download the APK from the newest release **on your phone** and install it
   (allow "install unknown apps" for your browser/file manager).
3. Log in → open **Reels** (either the Reels tab or any reel post from the feed).

### Do I need to enable anything in Piko settings / developer options?

**No — and this is important:**

- The **gear icon** on the feed's top bar opens *Piko* settings (download patches, ad removal,
  etc.). It has **no** fullscreen/edge-to-edge option — Piko does not contain such a patch.
- **Long-pressing the home icon** opens Instagram's *native* Developer Options / Quick
  Experiments menu (unlocked by Piko). It has hundreds of QE flags but none of them are
  InstaTrueReel — do not hunt there.

InstaTrueReel is **raw smali patching, always-on, zero settings**. It activates automatically
the moment you enter Reels and deactivates when you leave.

**How to confirm you're really running v0.8:** every time you enter Reels, a small popup
message (a "toast") appears at the bottom of the screen:

```
InstaTrueReel v0.8: strip-overlay ON
```

- **Toast shows + fullscreen video with the comment pill floating over it** → working.
- **Toast shows + still an opaque strip below the video** → grab the tiny log (below) and
  open an issue — v0.8's `v0.8 overlay:` / failure lines name exactly what happened.
- **No toast at all** → you are NOT running this build. The install failed or the old APK is
  still installed. Uninstall Instagram completely (check the app drawer — long-press →
  uninstall), reboot if in doubt, then install the v0.8 APK again.

Optional (advanced): run `adb logcat -s InstaTrueReel` while entering Reels — v0.8 logs
`apply: edge-to-edge engaged (fresh entry)`, `restore: ...`, per-view detail lines AND
the new strip-overlay telemetry:

```
v0.6 deblock eval: pager=m=0 main=m=0
v0.7 liberate: androidx.viewpager2.widget.ViewPager2 t=0 b=0 mb=0 fits=false h=1762 ph=1920   ← short container!
v0.7 liberate: chain freed (n=13)
v0.7 close: androidx.viewpager2.widget.ViewPager2 h=1762->1920 gap=158                          ← gap closed
v0.7 gaps closed (n=1)
v0.7 tree: X.XIU ... y=[1783..1908] w=996                                                        ← strip inventory
v0.7 tree: dump complete (n=57)
v0.8 apply: edge-to-edge engaged (fresh entry)
v0.8 overlay: com.instagram.ui.gesture.GestureManagerFrameLayout ty=-158 (bg cleared, video full-height)
v0.8: video already full-bleed (no strip)                                                        ← reels tab (inert)
v0.8 restore: strip overlay reverted
v0.7 restore-layout: heights restored (n=1)
```

If the strip persists, capture that log (it's small — `adb logcat -s InstaTrueReel` only
logs our tag) and open an issue: the `v0.8 overlay:` / `v0.8 restore:` lines say exactly
what was transformed, and a `v0.8: video container not found (DFS)` or `v0.8: video
parent not a LinearLayout` line names the exact divergence for a surgical v0.9.

### What v0.3 changes

- **The core fix:** Instagram v435 already contains a complete, engineered edge-to-edge Reels
  mode, gated by a server-side experiment (`9Wz.EEr()` = `!A2g && (A3H || QE flag)`). When the
  flag is off, the Reels action-bar theme feeds `bds_black` into the window-chrome writer —
  that opaque status-bar scrim is the black strip you see (the media container itself is
  already full-screen: `layout_clips_viewer_fragment`'s ViewPager2 is `match_parent ×
  match_parent`). v0.3 forces `EEr() → true`, which turns on Instagram's own native mode:
  transparent status bar, overlays self-padded by status-bar height via window insets
  (exactly the TikTok model).
- Both entry points covered: the Reels tab delegates `AFt.EEr()` to the same `9Wz` fragment.
- Status-bar color interceptor (`X/1fC.A04`) kept — while Reels is showing, *every* status-bar
  repaint (including Instagram's Choreographer-deferred writes) is forced fully transparent.
- **New:** navigation-bar color interceptor (`X/1fI.A04`) — the bottom strip goes transparent
  too (was still black in v0.2).
- Delayed re-apply engine (100/400/1000/2500 ms) re-asserts the state against late writes.
- Toast + logcat verification markers on every Reels entry.
- Leaving Reels: interceptors deactivate, original window chrome is restored — feed, stories,
  DMs keep their normal look.

### Reporting issues

Open an issue on this repo with:
- Phone model + Android version + nav mode (gesture / 3-button)
- Whether the **toast** appeared when entering Reels
- What looks off: e.g. "top bar overlaps the clock", "feed also went edge-to-edge",
  "comment box sits too low/high", "video letterboxed instead of filling"
- Screenshot if possible

## 🔧 How it works (technical)

- Base APK: `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-patches-v3.8.0.apk` (251 MB, Git LFS) — Instagram
  435.0.0.37.76 patched with [crimera/piko](https://github.com/crimera/piko) v3.8.0 via the
  Morphe patcher (static smali patching, ReVanced-style — no runtime hooking, so our dex edits
  are live code).
- Reels viewer identified as `X/9Wz` (`ClipsViewerFragment`) and reels tab as `X/AFt`
  (`ClipsTabFragment`) via Redex `__redex_internal_original_name` metadata.
- **`9Wz.EEr()Z` method body replaced** with `const/4 v0, 0x1; return v0` — the native
  edge-to-edge master switch.
- New smali classes `X/TTrueReelHelper` (window state machine + interceptors + toast/log) and
  `X/TTrueReelReapply` (scheduled re-apply Runnable); hooks injected into
  `onResume` / `onPause` / `onDestroyView` / `onHiddenChanged` of both fragments.
- `X/1fC.A04` = the single choke point for ALL status-bar color writes (direct +
  Choreographer-deferred via `3mE`/`ktp`); `X/1fI.A04` = the navigation-bar twin. Both are
  intercepted at method entry with activity-scoped guards, active only while Reels is showing.
- v0.2's `X/1fC.A06` interceptor was dropped — full-tree scan shows A06 has zero callers in
  v435 (dead code).
- All injections are register-safe (`{p0, p1}` non-range where indices < 16,
  `invoke-static/range {p0 .. p0}` elsewhere) and idempotent (marker comments).
- Instagram's layout resources in this build are in compressed-blob format
  (`L|offset|len|hash`), so patches are **pure smali** — resources and manifest pass through
  untouched.

### Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AnalyzeSmali.yml` | apktool decode (-r) + grep battery + full smali artifact for offline analysis |
| `BuildPatchedApk.yml` | decode → `patches/apply_patches.py` → apktool build → zipalign → apksigner → **final-APK verification** |

Run them from the **Actions** tab (workflow_dispatch).
