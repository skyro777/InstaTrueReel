# InstaTrueReel — Living Plan

Goal: Make Instagram Reels play **TikTok-style** on the user's device (Android 10, 9:16 display):

1. **True 9:16 / edge-to-edge media**: reel video drawn *under* the status bar (no black strip).
2. **Transparent status bar** (white icons overlay the video, like TikTok).
3. **Transparent nav bar / floating UI**: overlay UI floats above full-bleed media instead of shrinking it.
4. Keep everything else working (login, feed, stories, comments…).

Base APK: `Instagram-v435.0.0.37.76-patches-v3.8.0.apk` (251 MB, Git LFS, already third-party-patched once).

## Pipeline (all heavy work in GitHub Actions)

| Stage | Workflow | Status |
|---|---|---|
| jadx decompile (readable Java, deobf) | `DeCompileTheApk.yml` | ✅ done (run 34439742856) |
| apktool smali decode + grep battery | `AnalyzeSmali.yml` | ✅ done (run 34451536246) |
| patch + rebuild + sign APK | `BuildPatchedApk.yml` | ✅ v0.1.0-phase1 (run 34455447077) → ✅ v0.2.0-phase1.1 (run 34472181694) |

## Field test of v0.1.0 (user device, Android 10) + root-cause analysis

User report: entering Reels (tab + feed reel) → **no visible change**; black strip behind the
status bar remains. Deep-dive into the smali found the actual window-chrome machinery:

- **`X/1fC` = Instagram's central window-chrome controller** (Kotlin object):
  - `A04(Activity, color)` — the status-bar color setter, **with a Choreographer-deferred write
    path** (`WindowChromeColorDeferer`, `X/9wE` + `X/ktp` frame callback). Colors can land a
    frame (or more) AFTER a fragment's `onResume` — silently reverting any flags we set there.
  - `A06(View, Window, boolean)` — fullscreen toggle (`true` = show bar, `false` =
    FLAG_FULLSCREEN + SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN hide).
  - `A05/A07` — icon appearance helpers.
- **`InstagramMainActivity` already sets `systemUiVisibility(0x700)`** on the decor in its
  startup path (`A0h`/`A0i`) — the window is already laid out edge-to-edge-capable; the black
  strip the user sees is the **opaque `statusBarColor` scrim painted over the top of the
  content** by `1fC.A04` writes (theme black + deferred repaints).
- Phase-1 helper bug: `layoutInDisplayCutoutMode` was set to **2 = NEVER** instead of 1 =
  SHORT_EDGES (cosmetic on non-notch devices but wrong).
- Conclusion: Phase-1's single onResume apply could be (and was) overwritten after the fact.
  Fix = intercept the repaints themselves, not just apply once.

## Patch design (Phase 1.1 — SHIPPED in patches/, release v0.2.0-phase1.1)

`X/TTrueReelHelper` v2 (smali_classes16) — fields: saved window/activity/state, `A05` ACTIVE
flag, toast-shown flag, scheduler Handler + Runnable:

- `A00(Fragment)` APPLY — saves state once, applies edge-to-edge core, sets ACTIVE, shows a
  **one-time toast** ("InstaTrueReel v0.2: true 9:16 Reels ON") so users can verify the build,
  and schedules the re-apply engine.
- `A01(Fragment)` RESTORE — deactivates interceptors FIRST, cancels scheduled re-applies,
  restores saved window state.
- `A02(Fragment, hidden)` — onHiddenChanged bridge.
- `A03(Activity, color)I` — **interceptor**: while ACTIVE and activity == saved activity →
  returns 0x00000000 (fully transparent). Injected at the top of `1fC.A04` — defeats every
  status-bar repaint, deferred or not, scoped to Reels' own activity.
- `A04(Window, boolean)Z` — **interceptor**: while ACTIVE and window == saved window → returns
  true ("keep bar visible"). Injected at the top of `1fC.A06` — Instagram can never hide the
  status bar while Reels is showing (TikTok keeps it visible too).
- `A05()V` — schedules `X/TTrueReelReapply` at 100 / 400 / 1000 / 2500 ms (main Handler);
  cancels + re-targets on each apply; cancelled on restore.
- `A06(Window)V` — idempotent reapply core: 0x700 layout flags, white icons, transparent bars,
  SHORT_EDGES cutout (**fixed from NEVER**), contrast off, `requestApplyInsets()`.

Hooks (injected by `patches/apply_patches.py` v2, idempotent, marker-commented):

| Class | Method | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| X/9Wz (ClipsViewerFragment) | `onResume` | apply |
| X/9Wz | `onPause` | restore |
| X/9Wz | `onDestroyView` | restore |
| X/9Wz | `onHiddenChanged` (added override) | bridge |
| X/AFt (ClipsTabFragment) | `onResume` | apply |
| X/AFt | `onPause` (added override) | restore |
| X/AFt | `onDestroyView` | restore |
| X/AFt | `onHiddenChanged` (added override) | bridge |
| **X/1fC (window-chrome controller)** | `A04(Activity,I)` | color → transparent while Reels active |
| **X/1fC** | `A06(View,Window,Z)` | never hide status bar while Reels active |

Injected calls use `invoke-static/range {p0 .. p0}` where needed (35c limit); interceptor calls
use plain `invoke-static` (low register indices in 1fC methods). **Invoke arity is verified by
local baksmali round-trip** — an arity bug (`{p1}` vs a 2-arg method) assembles silently and
would crash at runtime with VerifyError; always round-trip check.

## Verified technical findings (raw smali = ground truth)

- Reels viewer = **`X/9Wz`** (`__redex_internal_original_name = "ClipsViewerFragment"`), in
  `smali_classes16`, extends `X/2yN` ("IgFragment") → `X/2Tg` → androidx Fragment.
- Reels tab host = **`X/AFt`** ("ClipsTabFragment"), also in `smali_classes16`, hosts a
  ViewPager2 whose child is the ClipsViewerFragment.
- `X.ked` / `X.2Ib` / `X.0Vv` are Instagram's own edge-to-edge/window helpers:
  - `0Vv.A00(window,false)` on API<30 = `systemUiVisibility |= 0x700`
    (LAYOUT_STABLE | LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN | LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION) — the TikTok-style window layout.
- `X.PNB` = Android-15 edge-to-edge enforcement shim (content padding + scrims) — only active
  on API 35+; NOT the cause of the black strip on Android 10.
- On Android 10 the "black strip + shrunken reel" = window-level: `decorFits=true`
  (default) + opaque black `statusBarColor` from theme. The clips fragment content simply
  fills the window content area below the status bar.
- Clips viewer fragment inflates `layout_clips_viewer_fragment` = compressed-blob layout
  ("L|offset|len|hash" resource format) → **resource XML patching is not possible**;
  all patches are pure smali.
- `X/fit` (gesture bottom padding) and `X/lOn`/`X/lOz` (top/bottom inset padding) are only
  attached in special paths (tablet / fullscreen-config / ModalActivity) — the normal phone
  reels path applies no insets itself; the fragment content would extend edge-to-edge
  automatically once the window is patched.

## Signing

`signing/instatruereel.jks` (PKCS12, RSA-4096, 30y) — dedicated mod key committed to the repo.
Signed with apksigner (v1+v2+v3). Installing over the previous third-party-patched build
requires uninstall first (signature change). **Never install over the official Instagram.**

## Known risks / follow-ups (Phase 2 candidates)

1. If the main tab host uses neither pause nor hide for tab fragments, the edge-to-edge state
   could leak to the main feed (cosmetic, not fatal). Fix: add restore-guards to home/search/
   profile tab fragments (`X/6Tt` HomeTabFragment, `X/1gE` MainFeedFragment, …).
2. Reels top bar (camera/search row) may sit very close to / overlap the status bar icons;
   TikTok offsets its top chrome by the status bar inset. If needed: add top-margin patch for
   the action bar container in the clips viewer (`instagram/features/clips/viewer/actionbar/`).
3. Comment sheet / reply bar inside reels may need bottom-inset tweaks while window is
   edge-to-edge (`ClipsViewerNavigationBar` = the bottom comment bar).
4. Status-bar icon color is forced light (white) in reels — matches TikTok over video.
5. Base APK is "patches-v3.8.0" (unknown third-party patcher; not InstaEclipse-the-Xposed-module
   — that ships v0.x). Patcher identity TBD; our patches are layered on top regardless.

---

# Phase 2 — v0.3.0 (NATIVE EDGE-TO-EDGE) — the real fix

## Field test of v0.2.0 (user device, Android 10)

User report: still **no change** and — critically — **no toast**. The v0.2 release artifact
was re-verified (helper class + toast string present in shipped dex), so the patched code
never executed on the device. Most likely cause: **signature-mismatch install failure** —
the user still had the base Piko APK (or v0.1.0) installed; Android silently refuses
"different signature" upgrades, leaving the old app running. v0.3 therefore: (a) shows the
toast on **every** Reels entry with the version string, (b) logs to logcat
(`adb logcat -s InstaTrueReel`), (c) README install section rewritten around the
uninstall-first requirement.

## Deep exploration (this phase) — the actual root cause of the black strip

Four parallel investigations (R-1 web research; E-1/E-2/E-4 smali deep-dives; local layout
decoding) converged on one mechanism:

- **`X/9Wz.EEr()Z` is Instagram's own edge-to-edge Reels master switch:**
  `EEr() = !ClipsViewerConfig.A2g && (A3H || QE flag BHQ(0x8109d400023873))`
  (server-config / Quick-Experiment gated — off for the user's account/device).
- `EEr()==false` → `X/2Iv` (reels delegate, classes17) feeds **`bds_black` (0x7f060052)**
  into `0jS.A1K → 1fC.A03 → 1fC.A04` → **opaque status-bar scrim = the black strip.**
- `EEr()==true` → `bds_transparent` (0x7f0600a9) + `2Iv.A0A()` registers a `6BM` insets
  listener on `8ug` (WindowInsetsManager) → `Fji(statusH, navH)` → `0jS.A15(statusBarHeight)`
  **pads the action-bar top containers by status-bar height** (TikTok-style self-padding
  overlays) and sets `0jS.A0D=true` so every activity resume repaints transparent.
- **The media container was already full-bleed all along**: decoded
  `layout_clips_viewer_fragment` (res/3da.xml, mapped from 0x7f0e0a4c via resources.arsc):
  root ConstraintLayout `match_parent × match_parent`, inner **ViewPager2 (0x7F0B3F45)
  `match_parent × match_parent`**, zero `fitsSystemWindows`. The window already runs
  `0x700` flags (MainActivity `A0h`/`A0i`). Only the opaque bar color hides the video.
- Both entry points funnel through the same switch: the Reels **tab** (`AFt.EEr()`)
  delegates to its child `9Wz` (interface `X/3Cz`); the **viewer** calls `9Wz.EEr()` directly.
  EEr's boolean also flows into the viewer item binders (`ACN → ACO.A0w → I45/XXz`).
- Dead code found: `1fC.A06` has **zero callers** in v435 (full-tree scan) — the v0.2
  interceptor on it was harmless but useless. Removed in v0.3.
- Gap found: navigation bar color flows through a twin writer `1fI.A04` (same deferred
  engine) — v0.2 left the bottom strip black. v0.3 intercepts it.
- R-1 research: base APK = **crimera/piko v3.8.0 applied via Morphe Manager** (static smali
  patcher, ReVanced-style — NOT LSPatch; our dex edits are live code). Piko settings =
  gear icon on feed top bar; "developer options" = **long-press home icon** (Instagram-native
  QE menu unlocked by Piko). Neither has any edge-to-edge option; no competing solution
  exists anywhere — InstaTrueReel is first.

## v0.3.0 patch set (SHIPPED)

1. **`9Wz.EEr()Z` → forced `true`** (method body replaced with `const/4 v0,0x1; return v0`)
   — turns on Instagram's own, fully-engineered edge-to-edge Reels mode.
2. `1fC.A04` color interceptor kept (transparent while Reels active — defeats all repaint
   paths incl. Choreographer-deferred writes).
3. **`1fI.A04` nav-bar interceptor added** (same pattern; bottom strip now transparent too).
4. `1fC.A06` interceptor dropped (dead code).
5. Fragment lifecycle hooks kept (scoping for interceptors + restore-on-exit).
6. Toast on **every fresh Reels entry** ("InstaTrueReel v0.3: true 9:16 Reels ON") +
   logcat markers (`InstaTrueReel` tag) + per-entry `Log.e` breadcrumbs.
7. Workflow: added "Verify patches are inside the final APK" step (string checks on the
   signed APK's dexes) + patch report artifact.

Pre-flight validation (local): full patch → `apktool b` assembly → jadx round-trip confirmed
`EEr() { return true; }` and `1fC.A04`/`1fI.A04` calling `TTrueReelHelper.A03/A07` first,
before the parent-climb and both write branches.

## Next (Phase 3 candidates — only if user reports residual issues)

- Comment sheet / bottom overlays inset tuning (if the comment bar overlaps the nav area).
- Top overlay ("Reels" header) offset polish if status-bar-height padding looks off.
- Non-9:16 reel letterboxing (fit vs fill) investigation if user reports pillarboxing.
- Optional Piko-settings-style toggle UI (out of scope unless requested).

---

# Phase 3 — v0.4.0 (TIKTOK-STYLE OVERLAYS)

## Field test of v0.3.0 (user device, Android 10, 9:16)

User report: reel video NOW stretches to the uppermost part of the screen and draws
behind the status bar — the EEr()=true patch is confirmed ACTIVE on-device. Remaining
problems: (a) the overlay bars did not become transparent ("any of the UI didn't became
transparent"), (b) the bottom-most edge is possibly not full-bleed. (Toast: user did not
focus on it; adb logcat file was captured but never reached the sandbox upload folder —
runtime confirmation of helper execution still pending.)

## Deep exploration (this phase) — subagent-driven, ground-truth smali

Three exploration subagents (E-1: top overlay; E-2: bottom overlay — hit turn limit,
re-done by orchestrator directly; E-3: complete EEr consumer map) ran against the
jadx Java artifact (44.8 MB, 90k files) and the FULL apktool smali decode (183 MB
artifact from the AnalyzeSmali run — the jadx artifact turned out to be missing 95%
of the ClipsViewerSource cluster, smali is the ground truth). Orchestrator then
re-verified every claim against the raw opcodes.

Key findings:

1. **EEr()==true top overlay is a 60%-alpha black gradient BY DESIGN.**
   `X/2Iv.A03()` (classes17) — the scrim provider — calls
   `34d.A01(ctx, TOP_BOTTOM, null, 0.6)` in the EEr==true branch (unique const-wide
   `0x3fe3333333333333L`). This scrim is THE action-bar background: it flows into
   `360.A09` -> `35U` -> `0jS.A1K` (Reels tab), into the legacy
   `ClipsViewerActionBar` (feed path, via `2LO.A00 = A03()`), and into the GeW
   re-apply. 60% black over video reads as near-opaque. TikTok uses ~20%.
2. **The EEr color choice (bds_black vs bds_transparent) is the STATUS BAR color**
   (`0jS.A1K -> 1fC.A03 -> 1fC.A04`), NOT the bar background. This corrects the
   v0.3 assumption in this document.
3. **Bottom comment bar:** `ClipsViewerNavigationBar.A00(bar, A8e-state)` — if ANY
   of the 5 A8e floats > 0 -> background = drawable `clips_viewer_action_bar_
   gradient_background` (0x7f08042b, strong black gradient strip). All-zero ->
   `setBackground(null)` (transparent). The gradient path is what the user sees.
4. **2Iv.APx has TWO theme builders** (tab path via source.A0C()==true; feed path
   otherwise). The feed-path `A1g==true` branch sets the bar bg to
   **bds_transparent** (ColorDrawable) — ALREADY transparent; E-3 initially misread
   the opcode order (0bF.A04(ctx)->v5 actually lands in `360.A03:I`, while
   `360.A01(I)` receives bds_transparent). => A1g needs NO patch.
5. **9Wz@6135 v99 QE gate -> 2IW ctor bool #56 -> field 2IW.A0I** — consumer found:
   a TextView text-size tweak in 2Iv (~line 14908). Visually irrelevant => NOT patched.
6. **9Wz@61719-61725 ModalActivity QE gate -> `0Ug.A02(root, lOn)`**: lOn = one-shot
   root BOTTOM pad by the nav-bar inset (type 0x207). Forcing it TRUE would PAD THE
   ROOT UP and BREAK bottom full-bleed => deliberately left server-false.
7. **9Wz.onViewCreated @61687-61695**: `A2C==true` pads root bottom by
   `tab_bar_height_panorama` (0x7f070254). A2C is server config; left alone for now
   (revisit only if user still reports a bottom gap).
8. EEr also offsets per-item litho content (`I45.A06` @876 pads by statusBarHeight)
   — already active via EEr=true.
9. `0jS.A0D()V` (a METHOD) clears click listeners — unrelated to insets; the `A0D`
   FIELD (set by A15) is the status-bar-padded flag. (Corrects v0.3 notes.)
10. `9Wz.A03:I` (top_of_feed_container top pad) has no writer in the base — stays 0.


## THE LOG (user's adb logcat, committed as logOfInstaTrueReel.txt) — root cause of v0.3's missing pieces

The user captured a full logcat (UTF-16 encoded, 5149 lines) and uploaded it to the repo root.
Decoded and analyzed: **the helper DID run — and crashed twice** (once per Reels entry,
23:14:44 tab path and 23:15:08):

```
E InstaTrueReel: v0.3 apply: exception (recovered)
E InstaTrueReel: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No virtual method getAttributes()
  Landroid/view/Window$LayoutParams; in class Landroid/view/Window;
E InstaTrueReel:     at X.TTrueReelHelper.A00(TTrueReelHelper:46)
E InstaTrueReel:     at X.9Wz.onResume(:0)
```

**Helper authoring bug:** the smali referenced `Landroid/view/Window$LayoutParams;`
—a class that does not exist in the Android framework. The real type is
`Landroid/view/WindowManager$LayoutParams;` (what `Window.getAttributes()` actually
returns). The bad descriptor assembled fine (smali does not resolve framework types)
and only failed lazily at first invoke on-device. Consequences:

- apply() died BEFORE the toast (explains "no toast") and BEFORE any window flags were
  set (explains the still-black bottom nav strip — "maybe not stretched up-to downmost").
- ACTIVE was never set -> the 1fC.A04/1fI.A04 interceptors never engaged.
- The visible top improvement came ENTIRELY from the EEr()=true patch (native pipeline
  feeds bds_transparent to the status bar) — consistent with the user's screenshots.
- The try/catch swallowed the error each time; zero successful applies, zero restores.

**Fix (v0.4): all 8 `Window$LayoutParams` references in helper_TTrueReelHelper.smali
corrected to `WindowManager$LayoutParams`.** With the helper alive, v0.4 gains: the
per-entry toast, 0x700 layout flags + transparent nav bar + contrast scrims off +
cutout SHORT_EDGES on the Reels window, ACTIVE-gated color interceptors, and the
100/400/1000/2500 ms re-apply engine — on top of the EEr native mode and the two new
TikTok-style overlay patches.

## v0.4.0 patch set (SHIPPED — updated after log analysis)

1. ALL v0.3 patches kept (EEr forced true; 1fC.A04 + 1fI.A04 color interceptors;
   9Wz/AFt lifecycle hooks; TTrueReelHelper + TTrueReelReapply + toast/logcat).
   **FIX: helper Window$LayoutParams -> WindowManager$LayoutParams (8 sites) — the
   crash found in the user's logcat.**
2. **NEW: `2Iv.A03()` scrim alpha 0.6 -> 0.2** (const-wide
   `0x3fe3333333333333L` -> `0x3fc999999999999aL`, marked
   `# instatruereel: 0.2 TikTok-style scrim`). One edit covers every top bar
   (tab action bar, feed legacy bar, GeW re-apply). TikTok-like legibility gradient.
3. **NEW: `ClipsViewerNavigationBar.A00` `:cond_e` -> null background** (replaces
   the `getDrawable(0x7f08042b)` block with `const/4 v0, 0x0`). The bottom comment
   bar is now always fully transparent — TikTok-style floating row over the video.
4. Helper version strings bumped v0.3 -> v0.4 (toast: "InstaTrueReel v0.4:
   TikTok-style Reels ON").
5. apply_patches.py v4: two new `replace_unique` patches with uniqueness
   pre-checks, method-signature sanity checks, marker/idempotency, a NEGATIVE
   verification (0x7f08042b must be gone), full report.
   Locally validated against the exact base decode (all 22 checks [ ok ],
   idempotent re-run clean).

## Next (Phase 4 candidates — after v0.4 field test)

- Get the user's adb logcat (upload failed to reach the sandbox so far) to confirm
  helper execution, nav-bar transparency writes, and per-path behavior.
- If bottom-most still not full-bleed: investigate A2C / tab_bar_height_panorama
  padding and the nav-bar color write path on the Reels tab (MainActivity).
- If the top bar sits too close to the status bar icons: 0jS.A15 padding polish.
- If legibility suffers at 0.2 alpha: consider 0.25-0.3.

---

# Phase 4 — v0.5.0 (FULL-BLEED BOTTOM + MODAL PATH)

## Field test of v0.4.0 (user device, Android 10, 9:16 — log logOfInstaTrueReel.log)

v0.4 CONFIRMED WORKING: zero helper exceptions; 5 clean apply/restore cycles;
toast on every entry; **top status bar transparent + video under it on both
MainTabActivity paths (home-feed entry and Reels tab)**. The PhoneWindow log
proves our re-apply engine wins the nav-bar color war: `setNavigationBarColor: 0`
lands at exactly +1000/+2500 ms after each apply, defeating Instagram's
`ff0c1014` re-writes.

Remaining failures (user report + log correlation):

1. **Reels TAB path**: main bottom tab bar opaque; video stops above it.
2. **FEED path** (Context-Preserving): bottom comment row area opaque.
3. **WATCH HISTORY / LIKED path**: toast shows but status bar stays BLACK.
   Log timeline: ModalActivity (`com.instagram.modal.ModalActivity`) launches at
   14:53:37.894 → apply at 14:53:38.019 → `setNavigationBarColor: ff0c1014`
   1 ms later. The reels viewer is hosted INSIDE ModalActivity on this path.

## Root causes (ground-truth smali + decoded resources)

1. **Main tab bar = stacking layout, not overlay.** `InstagramMainActivity.A0V`
   sets `swipeable_tab_view_pager` (0x7f0b3f45) `bottomMargin = tabBarHeight`
   (dimen attr 0x7f040d30) while the tab bar is visible; the startup lambda
   `A0h` does the same to `layout_container_main` (0x7f0b2246). The video
   physically cannot reach the screen bottom until those margins are zero.
2. **Tab bar color writers** (all opaque): `X/0bQ.A04` (theme/config path) and
   `X/2ZS.A0A` (reels-open + immersive-drag lerp; also colors the DECOR view
   and `tab_bar_shadow`). `X/0bI.A0B` sets tab icon colors (lerp to black).
3. **ModalActivity (Watch History) status bar**: `ModalActivity.A2T()` writes
   the status-bar color DIRECTLY from the `status_bar_color` intent extra
   (bypasses our 1fC.A04 interceptor), and sets
   `layout_container_parent.setFitsSystemWindows(true)` (extra default) —
   the root is padded below the status bar, so the black window background
   fills the bar area. On Android 10 (`3sA.A02()` = SDK>=35 = false) the
   `IgFragmentActivity` case-0 content-padding listener is NOT registered, so
   fitsSystemWindows is the ONLY padding mechanism — clearing it fixes the path.
4. **ClipsViewerNavigationBar is the TOP title/search row** (fields:
   ActionBarTitleViewSwitcher, search edit text 0x7f0b00d7, Carrera camera
   stub, news-feed button) — the v0.4 "bottom comment bar" analysis was
   actually about the top row (the patch is harmless/beneficial and kept).
   The actual bottom comment row is Litho-rendered (`X/XIU.A0i` builds the
   "Add a comment" row with `clips_viewer_comment_bar_background` = rounded
   grey stroke pill — NOT the opaque black). The opaque black at the bottom
   is the window decor behind the video + the container margins from (1).

## v0.5.0 patch set (locally validated: 39/39 checks, patched dexes assemble)

1. All v0.3/v0.4 patches kept (EEr=true; 1fC.A04/1fI.A04 interceptors;
   9Wz/AFt lifecycle hooks; helper + reapply + toast/logcat; 2Iv.A03 scrim
   0.2; ClipsViewerNavigationBar null background).
2. **`2ZS.A0A` lerp gate**: after both `4u9.A02` color lerps, if
   `TTrueReelHelper.A05` → force v2=v5=0x00000000. Covers tab bar, tablet
   rail, tab_bar_shadow and the decor recolor on every reels drag/open.
3. **`0bQ.A04` gate**: while reels active, redirect color resources to
   `bds_transparent` (0x7f0600a9) — covers theme/config re-applies.
4. **`0bI.A0B` gate**: while reels active, active icon = white, normal icon =
   70% white (Integer-boxed) — TikTok-style icons over video.
5. **Helper `A08(Activity)`**: zeroes bottomMargin of 0x7f0b3f45 and
   0x7f0b2246 while reels active (saves originals; `A10` restores on exit;
   re-applied at 100/400/1000/2500/5000 ms — 5th delay added).
6. **Helper `A09(Activity)`**: ModalActivity path — when
   `layout_container_parent` (0x7f0b224a) shows insets padding, set
   `fitsSystemWindows(false)` + zero top/bottom padding; `A10` restores.
7. **TTrueReelReapply v0.5** carries the Activity reference and re-enforces
   A06 + A08 + A09 on every tick.
8. v0.5 strings + diagnostic logcat markers per action ("v0.5 deblock: ...",
   "v0.5 modal: ...") so the next field log proves exactly what ran.

## Local validation performed (first time fully offline)

- `apply_patches.py v5` run against the full 177k-file base decode: all
  patches applied, 39/39 verification checks pass.
- `apktool b` locally assembled every PATCHED dex (classes10/13/15/16/17)
  cleanly; assembled dexes string-verified (v0.5 markers present, no
  `Window$LayoutParams` crash signature anywhere).

## Next (Phase 5 candidates — after v0.5 field test)

- If feed-path bottom still shows an opaque strip: inspect the Litho bottom
  overlay section (`X/2QX` family) for a full-width row background.
- If tab icons flicker during the exit animation: gate 2ZS.A0B restore path.
- If ModalActivity still shows one black frame at entry: patch the direct
  `setStatusBarColor` write in ModalActivity.A2T (line ~241) to 0 while the
  modal hosts the clips viewer.
- A2C / tab_bar_height_panorama bottom pad if a gap remains in the tab path.

# Phase 5 — v0.6.0 (CHAIN LIBERATION + FULL DIAGNOSTICS)

## Field test of v0.5.0 (user device, Android 10, 9:16 — log android_live_log.txt, 16 MB)

User sequence captured live: home-feed reel entry (~20:16:00, MainTabActivity overlay)
→ back to feed (20:16:21) → Watch History reel (20:16:37, ModalActivity) → back
(20:16:51) → Likes reel (20:17:00, ModalActivity). Verified from the log:

- **v0.5 hooks fire on ALL entry points** — 5 clean apply/restore markers, toasts
  confirmed via NotificationService lines, **zero helper exceptions** anywhere.
- **The nav-bar color war is won on every path**: our re-apply engine's
  `setNavigationBarColor: 0` lands at +100/400/1000/2500/5000 ms and stays 0.
- **Watch History / Likes reels run in `com.instagram.modal.ModalActivity`** — a
  separate window (am_create_activity/am_destroy around each session, ACTIVITY_RESULT
  return path).
- User-visible result: Reels tab = fully fixed (both bars transparent). Home-feed
  entry = status bar transparent but the comment-bar area stays opaque black
  (red-arrow screenshot: video cut off above the "Add comment..." row, solid black
  below it). Watch History / Likes = NOTHING transparent despite the toast.

## Root cause — the v0.5 runtime fixes were silent no-ops

The 16 MB log contains **zero** `v0.5 deblock:` and **zero** `v0.5 modal:` lines —
the only two log lines those code paths could ever print. The re-apply Runnable
provably executed (it calls A06+A08+A09 on every tick, and A06's nav-color writes
are all over the PhoneWindow log), so A08/A09 ran ~6 times per entry and silently
skipped every time:

- A08: `findViewById(0x7f0b3f45/0x7f0b2246)` → null (or margin already 0) on the
  running tree → guarded skip, no log → the feed-path bottom stayed blocked.
- A09: `findViewById(0x7f0b224a)` → null, or the `padding > 0` precondition false
  (padding only appears after the first insets dispatch; the fresh-entry call runs
  before the modal's first frame) → guarded skip, no log → the modal root kept
  `fitsSystemWindows=true`, content stayed inset away from the bars, and the
  transparent bars revealed the black window background ("nothing transparent").

Lesson: **runtime view-tree surgery keyed to hardcoded view ids with silent guards
is unfixable blind** — v0.6 removes the id dependency AND makes every step loud.

## v0.6.0 patch set

1. All v0.3/v0.4/v0.5 patches kept unchanged (EEr=true; 1fC.A04/1fI.A04
   interceptors; 9Wz/AFt lifecycle hooks; re-apply engine + toast/logcat;
   2Iv.A03 scrim 0.2; ClipsViewerNavigationBar null background; 2ZS.A0A +
   0bQ.A04 + 0bI.A0B tab-bar transparency/icons).
2. **NEW helper A09/A11/A12 — chain liberation**: walk from the reels fragment's
   own view (`Fragment.getView()`) up the parent chain to the window decor. For
   every ancestor ViewGroup: save (paddingTop, paddingBottom, bottomMargin,
   fitsSystemWindows) ONCE into a new `A0G` ArrayList of `X/TTrueReelViewSave`,
   then zero all four while reels is active. One mechanism, no view ids:
   - ModalActivity path: `layout_container_parent` is an ancestor → its
     fitsSystemWindows insets padding (the black strip) is removed → video runs
     under status + nav bars (colors already won by A06).
   - Home-feed overlay path: every container bounding the video in
     MainTabActivity is an ancestor → bottom margins/padding zeroed → video
     reaches the screen bottom behind the comment row.
   - Reels-tab path: same walk is a no-op (already full-bleed per field test).
3. **Restore on exit (A10)**: walks the save list, restores padding/margins/fits,
   re-dispatches insets (`requestApplyInsets`), then the v0.5 margin restores.
4. **Re-apply engine re-runs the walk** at 100/400/1000/2500/5000 ms — late
   re-blocks (Instagram re-setting margins mid-session) are re-liberated; already-
   saved views are re-zeroed via the identity scan in A11.
5. **`getFitsSystemWindows()` read is exception-guarded** with an insets-padding
   heuristic fallback (hidden-API safety on OEM builds).
6. **A08 rewritten**: keeps the two specific margin zeroings but logs an eval
   line on EVERY call (`v0.6 deblock eval: pager=m=248|null main=...`) so the
   next field log proves whether those ids resolve at all.
7. **FULL DIAGNOSTICS**: per-view detail lines
   (`v0.6 liberate: <class> t=<pad> b=<pad> mb=<margin> fits=<b>`),
   `v0.6 liberate: chain freed (n=..)`, `v0.6 restore-layout: chain restored
   (n=..)`, and every catch block logs its exception — the v0.5 silent-no-op
   failure mode is structurally impossible now.
8. Version strings bumped (toast: "InstaTrueReel v0.6: full-bleed everywhere ON").

## Local validation performed (offline, no base decode needed)

- The three helper smali files assemble cleanly with smali 2.5.2 (`--api 29`).
- baksmali round-trip is **byte-identical** (md5 match) — register allocation,
  the `invoke-direct/range {v2 .. v7}` constructor arity, and the nested
  try/catch (hidden-API fallback) all survive reassembly.
- apply_patches.py v6 carries 57 positive checks + 2 negative checks (incl. new
  ViewSave class checks); BuildPatchedApk.yml final-APK verification updated to
  the v0.6 marker strings + automated release creation via GITHUB_TOKEN.

## Next (Phase 6 candidates — after v0.6 field test)

- Read the v0.6 field log's `v0.6 liberate:` lines: they print every ancestor's
  real class + padding/margins — if any path still shows a strip, the culprit
  view is now NAMED in the log and can be patched at the source (v0.7).
- `scripts/analyze.sh` now dumps ModalActivity.smali + the 0x7f0b224a/0x7f0b2246/
  0x7f0b3f45 const-contexts + the 2QX overlay family + lOn/lOz/0Ug/fit helpers —
  run AnalyzeSmali once for the exact A2T/A0V/A0h bodies for surgical v0.7 patches
  (e.g., gate ModalActivity.A2T's direct status-bar write + fitsSystemWindows(true)
  at the source).
- If the comment pill should float HIGHER over the nav gesture area: bottom inset
  padding tweak for the Litho comment row (X/XIU.A0i / clips comment bar).
- On Android 15+ devices: color writes become no-ops (targetSdk 35) — the chain
  liberation + EEr native mode remain the working mechanism (future-proof).

---

# Phase 6 — v0.7.0 (BOTTOM-GAP CLOSURE + STRIP TELEMETRY)

## Field test of v0.6.0 (user device, Android 10, 9:16 — log live_log.txt, 1.1 MB,
## screenshot Screenshot_20260914-150151__01.jpg — PIXEL-VERIFIED)

User sequence: home-feed reel entry only. Verified from the log + pixel analysis
of the screenshot:

- **STATUS BAR FIXED ON EVERY PATH** — the v0.6 chain liberation zeroed the t=63
  status inset on `TouchInterceptorCoordinatorLayout`; video now runs under the
  transparent status bar on home-feed, Watch History, Likes AND the Reels tab.
  The nav-bar color war stays won (setNavigationBarColor: 0 on every tick).
- **The comment-bar strip remains opaque** (home-feed + Watch History + Likes):
  pixel-verified geometry (1080x1920): video ends at y=1762; the Litho
  "Add comment…" pill (rounded #25282d, 126 px tall, x=42..1038 — the XIU-built
  row with `clips_viewer_comment_bar_background` 0x7f08042f) sits on an opaque
  #0c1014 strip (158 px = the old tab-bar slot; 21 px above the pill, 11 px
  below, side margins).
- The v0.6 walk log is decisive: **every ancestor has b=0 mb=0** (13 chain
  entries, only t=63 was non-zero). The bound on the video is NOT padding and
  NOT margin — it is STRUCTURAL: a container in the chain is simply SHORTER
  than its parent (LayoutParams.height or parent measurement), with the comment
  bar occupying the slot below it (sibling layout). The chain (fragment → decor):
  IgFrameLayout → FrameLayout → X.0fo (ViewPager2's RecyclerView = the vertical
  reels pager "ClipsViewPagerImpl" owned by 9Wz via X/ADl) → ViewPager2 →
  IgFrameLayout → ConstraintLayout → TouchInterceptorCoordinatorLayout →
  SwipeNavigationContainer → IgFrameLayout → ContentFrameLayout →
  FitWindowsLinearLayout → FrameLayout → LinearLayout (decor root).
- Static ground truth (full 177k-smali decode artifact re-downloaded + jadx):
  * `X/ADl` = the fragment's "ClipsViewPagerImpl" (owns the vertical pager A0A,
    VelocityTracker drag floats, ACN item-binder ref) — 9Wz constructs it.
  * `X/XIU.A0i` (smali_classes10) builds the comment pill Litho row: drawable
    0x7f08042f, 30dp corner radius, string 0x7f131bf3 ("Add a comment…").
  * The bundled ConstraintLayout is Meta-repackaged: its LayoutParams class is
    the fully-obfuscated `LX/0fW;` (fields A00..A0d) — blind constraint-field
    surgery is NOT possible; ConstraintLayout-parent children are skipped (and
    logged) by the v0.7 gap closure until the field map is derived (v0.8).

## v0.7.0 patch set

1. All v0.3–v0.6 patches kept unchanged (EEr=true; 1fC/1fI interceptors;
   9Wz/AFt lifecycle hooks; re-apply engine + toast/logcat; 2Iv scrim 0.2;
   ClipsViewerNavigationBar null background; 2ZS/0bQ/0bI tab-bar gates;
   v0.6 chain liberation + ViewSave).
2. **NEW helper A15/A16 — bottom-gap closure**: walk the ancestor chain
   TOP-DOWN (decor-most first); for every view whose bottom edge falls short of
   its parent's content bottom, set `LayoutParams.height` to exactly reach it.
   Original heights saved once (A0H views / A0I boxed Integers, identity scan),
   restored on exit (A10). RecyclerView parents (they control child bounds) and
   ConstraintLayout parents (constraint anchors; obfuscated LP fields) are
   skipped but logged (`v0.7 close: skip-rv/cl-skip <class>`). Because height
   changes settle on the NEXT layout pass, the re-apply ticks cascade the
   closure level by level (100/400/1000/2500/5000 ms) — apply closes the
   outermost short container, +100 ms the next level, etc.
3. **A11 detail line extended with h=<height> ph=<parentHeight>** — every
   ancestor's height + its parent's height is now in the log; every SHORT
   container is named directly.
4. **NEW helper A17/A18 — one-shot bottom-strip tree dump** at the +100 ms
   re-apply tick (2nd A15 invocation, overlay laid out): recursively logs every
   view whose absolute bottom edge is in the bottom 35% of the screen — class,
   resource id (hex), absolute y-range, width, height; GONE views skipped;
   capped at 260 lines. This names the comment-pill container, every wrapper
   around it, and every bounded container in one shot.
5. A10 restore extended: heights restored (parallel lists) BEFORE the chain
   restore; both lists cleared.
6. Version strings bumped (toast: "InstaTrueReel v0.7: gap-closure ON").

## Local validation performed (offline, against the FULL 177k-file base decode)

- smali 2.5.2 assemble --api 29: CLEAN; baksmali round-trip BYTE-IDENTICAL
  (md5 match) — register allocation, nested try/catch, and all invoke arities
  survive reassembly.
- apply_patches.py v7 run against the full base decode: ALL patches applied,
  ~90 verification checks pass (incl. all new v0.7 needles), idempotent re-run
  clean (exit 0).
- Every patched target file (9Wz/AFt/1fC/1fI/2Iv/2ZS/0bQ/0bI/navbar/helper)
  assembles individually.
- BuildPatchedApk.yml: v0.7 dex-marker verification (12 final-APK string
  checks), release tag v0.7.0-phase6, YAML validated.

## Expected on-device (v0.7)

- If the bound is a FrameLayout-family height (e.g., the vertical reels pager
  inside its IgFrameLayout host, or a feed container): video extends to the
  screen bottom, the comment pill floats over it (TikTok-style), restore on
  exit intact.
- If the bound is a ConstraintLayout constraint: unchanged visuals, but the log
  now contains `v0.7 close: cl-skip <class>` + the h/ph chain telemetry + the
  full bottom-strip tree dump — a surgical v0.8 can then clear the exact
  constraint field (map via the X/0fW solver) or patch the layout builder at
  the source.

## Next (Phase 7 candidates — after v0.7 field test)

- Read the new log: `v0.7 close:` lines (what was closed, old→new height),
  `v0.7 gaps closed (n=)`, `v0.7 liberate: … h=… ph=…` (short containers),
  `v0.7 tree:` (full bottom-strip inventory). One small logcat capture names
  whatever remains.
- If `cl-skip` lines appear for the binding container: derive the X/0fW
  constraint field map (which A0x field is bottomToTopOf/bottomToBottomOf) from
  the ConstraintLayout solver smali, then clear the bottom anchor at runtime
  (v0.8) — or patch the overlay layout builder at the source.
- If the strip persists with NO short container anywhere: the bound lives
  INSIDE the fragment's Litho item (stacked section) — patch the item root
  builder (ACO.A0w / I45 family) so the media component gets the full page
  height and the comment row overlays (v0.8 static Litho patch).

## Phase 7 — v0.8.0-phase7: strip-overlay transformation (comment-bar fix)

Field evidence (v0.7 build, log.txt 2026-09-14 17:29, home-feed entry):
- v0.7 gap closure WORKED: settled strip dump shows the full ancestor chain
  at [0..1920] (ConstraintLayout 0x7f0b2248, IgFrameLayout 0x7f0b2246,
  outer ViewPager2 0x7f0b3f45 — all closed by A15/A16 across ticks).
- The strip dump NAMED the residual bound: inside the fragment root
  IgLinearLayout 0x7f0b0bbd (vertical): GestureManagerFrameLayout
  0x7f0b1b41 [0..1762] (weighted video child, 158px short) and the opaque
  IgLinearLayout 0x7f0b0b96 [1762..1920] strip containing IgFrameLayout ->
  pill IgLinearLayout 0x7f0b0d72 (126px) -> IgTextView 0x7f0b0d7a
  ("Add comment..."). Tab-bar proxies confirmed invisible (overlay only).
- VLM pixel check of Screenshot_20260914-155851.jpg: status bar transparent
  (v0.6 win holds), opaque near-black bottom bar with pill remains.

Fix (helper A19/A1A/A1B/A1C/A1D/A1E):
1. DFS down from the fragment view (depth <= 8) for
   GestureManagerFrameLayout; fallback ClipsSwipeRefreshLayout + climb to
   the direct LinearLayout child. Parent must be a LinearLayout.
2. video LayoutParams.height = parent height; LinearLayout weight ZEROED
   (weighted children are re-measured to leftover space — zeroing the
   weight is what makes the height stick).
3. strip.setTranslationY(-stripH): LinearLayout lays it out below the
   now-full-height video; the negative translation returns it to the same
   on-screen position, drawn ON TOP of the video (later sibling). Touch
   dispatch maps through the translation matrix, so the pill stays
   clickable.
4. setBackground(null) on the strip + its direct children (<= 4); the pill
   two levels down keeps its rounded background.
5. A1D saves (height/weight/translationY/backgrounds) once; A1B restores on
   exit (A10) and on fresh entry (A00). Re-assert (idempotent) every tick.
6. Inert on the reels tab (strip gap == 0 -> "video already full-bleed").

Open items for v0.9 (if needed): if Watch History / Likes show
"v0.8: video container not found (DFS)" or "video parent not a
LinearLayout" in logcat, capture `adb logcat -s InstaTrueReel` — the
v0.8 lines will name the exact divergence of the ModalActivity tree.

## Phase 8 — v0.9.0-phase8: TikTok-style horizontal fullscreen (SHIPPED, broken)

**Goal:** TikTok's "Full screen" experience for landscape (16:9-ish) reels: a
"Full screen" pill floats in the letterbox bar under a landscape video; tapping
it rotates the whole app to landscape (TikTok rotates the entire app + swaps
the player UI); tapping the "x" exit circle returns to portrait.

**Implementation (v0.9):** A20-A27 + fs* fields + TTrueReelClick +
TTrueReelRecheck. Detection: largest TextureView under the fragment view,
landscape iff w > 1.25*h (event-driven via ViewTreeObserver - no timers).
Enter: setRequestedOrientation(SENSOR_LANDSCAPE=6) + strip GONE (video gets
the full height via the v0.8 reassert engine re-run) + exit circle top-left.
Exit / reels-exit: PORTRAIT(1) + strip VISIBLE + full cleanup (A27).

**Field test result (2026-09-14 log.txt + 2 screenshots):** pill appears and
is correctly placed (VLM-verified TikTok-style under the letterboxed video);
tap -> the app DID rotate to landscape (ROTATION_90, config 1920x1080
delivered) but snapped back to portrait ~0.7s later with a mangled layout
(video squished left, huge black bar right; engine re-applied landscape dims
into the re-portraited screen).

## Phase 8.1 — v0.9.1-phase8.1: THE ROTATION-FIGHT FIX (SHIPPED)

**Root-cause analysis (log.txt timeline + full smali sweep of the ground-truth
decode):**

- 23:45:11.937 — on ModalActivity LAUNCH, Instagram itself calls
  `setRequestedOrientation(1)` (portrait lock), logged right next to
  "morphe: Utils: Set activity".
- 23:45:17.986 — OUR engage: `setRequestedOrientation(6)`; display rotates
  0→1 at 18.165.
- 23:45:18.198 — **Instagram calls setRequestedOrientation(1) again, +33ms
  after the engage** — a REACTIVE portrait lock fired by the config change.
- 23:45:18.276 — OUR OWN A01 restore fires (the rotation's config change
  flaps the clips fragment lifecycle: pause → resume ~112ms later) → A27
  sets portrait too + full teardown.
- 23:45:18.913 — Instagram locks portrait AGAIN (second config delivery).
- Same pattern repeats identically in the second session (26.020/26.086/
  26.651). Screen frozen +452ms during the fight.

**The portrait-lock machinery (found in the smali ground truth):**

- `X/6mW` = **`FixedOrientationCompat`** — the single funnel wrapper for every
  app-side `setRequestedOrientation` (catches the "Only fullscreen activities
  can request orientation" IllegalStateException; logs tag
  "FixedOrientationCompat").
- `X/0XU.A00(activity)` — "app-preferred orientation": `1un.A09(activity)`
  (is-tablet check, ≥600dp) ? 13 (userLandscape) : **1 (PORTRAIT)** — posted
  DEFERRED via the `X/0XX` runnable onto a background executor.
- `BaseFragmentActivity.A1p(Configuration, X/2y8)` — Instagram's
  onConfigurationChanged wrapper: on EVERY config delivery, if
  `!A05 && A0I` ("should_allow_rotation") → `0XU.A00(this)` → deferred
  PORTRAIT. **This is the reactive lock — it fires twice per rotation cycle.**
- `ModalActivity.onCreate`: reads the `"lock_to_portrait"` intent extra →
  `A2Q(!lockToPortrait)` → sets `A0I` + calls `0XU.A00` — the launch lock.
- `BaseFragmentActivity.A2Q(false)` → LOCKED(14) freeze path (immersive off).
- Both `InstagramMainActivity` AND `ModalActivity` extend
  `BaseFragmentActivity` → the same lock fights in every entry point.
- Other `6mW` callers (camera IgLiveCaptureFragment/OnlyQuickCaptureFragment,
  IgReactActivity, cloud-streaming, bloks/order/signed-out activities) also
  funnel through the same wrapper.
- The earlier ROADMAP claim "ZERO setRequestedOrientation callers in the host
  activities" was wrong: the sweep only matched DIRECT invocations and missed
  everything routed through the 6mW wrapper.

**The v0.9.1 patch set (patcher v10):**

1. **ORIENTATION-LOCK GATE** — `X/6mW.A00` head-gated with
   `TTrueReelHelper.A28(activity)`: while `fsForced && activity == saved`,
   the call returns without setting anything (log: "v0.9 fs: portrait-lock
   blocked"). This neutralizes the launch lock, the A1p reactive lock AND
   every other app path, scoped to our activity only. Our own A26/A27 exit
   paths call `Activity.setRequestedOrientation` DIRECTLY (not via 6mW) and
   are unaffected.
2. **TRANSIENT-ROTATION GUARD (A01)** — `.locals` 4→5; at the top: if
   `fsForced` && the fragment's activity == saved activity && NOT
   `isFinishing()` && `uptimeMillis() - fsEngageAt < 1500ms` → skip the
   entire restore (log: "v0.9 restore skipped (fs transient)"). The
   rotation's own lifecycle flap (pause→resume ~112ms) is not a reels exit.
   Real exits (activity finishing / any hook after the window) still do the
   full restore.
3. **AUTO-EXIT (A20, TikTok behavior)** — while landscape, every layout pass
   re-runs the detection DFS; 2 CONSECUTIVE non-landscape detections (no
   surface / <40px / w ≤ 1.25·h) return to portrait via A26 (log: "v0.9 fs:
   auto-exit (video no longer landscape)"). Counting disabled for the first
   1500ms after the engage (the rotation transition re-measures the video);
   landscape detection resets the counter.
4. **HOOK-SOURCE LOGGING (A2B..A2F)** — the restore hooks now call per-source
   bridges so the next field log names WHICH lifecycle event fired:
   A2B=viewer onPause, A2C=viewer onDestroyView, A2D=tab onPause,
   A2E=tab onDestroyView, A2F=hidden (via the A02 bridge). Each logs
   "v0.9 hook: restore src=N (...)" then runs A01.
5. New fields `fsEngageAt:J` (engage uptime) + `fsNonLand:I` (debounce
   counter); A24 records the engage time + resets the counter; A26/A27 reset
   it on every exit path. Toast bumped to v0.9.1.

**Local validation performed (offline, against the FULL ground-truth decode
re-downloaded from the Actions artifacts):**

- Helper v0.9.1 assembles with smali 2.5.2 --api 29: CLEAN; baksmali
  round-trip instruction-identical (labels/.locals cosmetics only).
- Patcher v10 run against the full 177k-file base decode: ALL patches
  applied, ~120 verification checks pass (incl. the 15 new v0.9.1 needles),
  idempotent re-run clean (exit 0).
- Every patched target file (9Wz/AFt/1fC/1fI/2Iv/2ZS/0bQ/0bI/6mW/navbar +
  the 5 helper classes) assembles individually.
- BuildPatchedApk.yml: v0.9.1 dex-marker verification (26 final-APK string
  checks incl. 6 new v0.9.1 needles), release tag v0.9.1-phase8.1, YAML
  validated.

**Expected on-device (v0.9.1):**

- Tap "Full screen" on a landscape reel → the app rotates to REAL landscape
  and STAYS there: video edge-to-edge, strip hidden, "x" exit circle
  top-left; the log shows "portrait-lock blocked" instead of the old
  restore/apply flapping.
- Tap x / leave Reels / back-press → portrait + full chrome restore.
- Swipe to a portrait reel while landscape → auto-exit to portrait.
- Portrait reels browsing unchanged (v0.8 behavior intact).

**Lag watch (user reports slight lag):** unchanged from v0.9 analysis — the
reapply engine is bounded (5 ticks per entry), v0.9.1 adds no timers; all
fullscreen logic stays event-driven. Suspected cause remains 4K feed decode.

**Phase 9 candidates (unchanged):** dedicated landscape player UI (scrubber,
timestamps, speed, CC), portrait-chrome hiding in landscape (top bar / action
rail / captions), auto-exit on swipe (DONE in v0.9.1), action-rail hiding,
icon drawable fallback for the pill glyph.

**Phase 9+ ideas from the field evidence:** the "not even normal looking
horizontal" screenshot (portrait UI + rotated/squished video + right black
bar) is the mid-fight state; with the rotation sticking, Instagram's own
onConfigurationChanged path (9Wz re-reads screen dims) should lay its chrome
out sanely — if anything still looks off in landscape, capture the new log
("v0.9 hook: restore src=" lines will name the exact lifecycle flow) and a
screenshot; a Phase 10 can then hide the portrait chrome explicitly while
fsForced.

# Phase 9 — v0.10.0-phase9: THE OVERLAY PLAYER (real TikTok landscape fullscreen)

## Field test of v0.9.1 (user device, Android 10 — log log.txt 952KB, screenshots
## Screenshot_20260919-214238/-214248 — DIAGNOSED)

Two distinct failures, both now understood:

1. **Spurious auto-exits** (the "not stable" complaint): the log shows the
   engage -> 5.5s -> `auto-exit (video no longer landscape)` -> pill re-created
   IMMEDIATELY (the video was still landscape!) -> user re-tapped -> 3.5s ->
   auto-exit again. Root cause: v0.9.1's auto-exit re-measured the video view
   every tick while IN landscape, and any transient (stale fragment view after
   the rotation flap, TextureView briefly <40px, DFS finding nothing) counted
   as "non-landscape" twice -> exit. The measurement was never a reliable
   signal for "user swiped to a portrait reel".
2. **Landscape layout chaos** (the "not even normal looking" screenshots):
   VLM analysis of both screenshots shows Instagram's portrait layout winning
   the fight — video occupying only the bottom ~55-60% (portrait-computed
   608px height inside the 1080px landscape window), a huge top black bar,
   the portrait chrome (Reels/Friends header, partial side rail, caption
   block) floating over/behind it. The v0.8 reassert engine and Instagram's
   relayout code kept trading blows (log: endless `close:` cycles, and
   `close: ViewPager2 h=-1->1920` — Instagram setting PORTRAIT heights while
   in landscape).

## The v0.10 architecture — stop fighting, take the video

Core insight from smali research: the reels TextureView is created and owned
by the Groot video glue — `X/1j4` "GrootReuseTextureViewControllerImpl"
(`Ao2` = createPlayerViewForAttach) — which REUSES TextureViews and sets a
SurfaceTextureListener (`X/1x5`) on them that (re)binds the surface to the
HeroPlayer on every attach. Playback is keyed on the 7ky (SimpleVideoLayout)
view, which never detaches when only the TextureView moves. Therefore:
**reparenting the TextureView into our own decor overlay keeps the video
playing, edge-to-edge, untouchable by Instagram's layout code.**

What v0.10 builds (all in helper A2G..A2U + 3 new classes):

- `A2G` overlay builder: opaque black fullscreen FrameLayout on the decor;
  top info bar (gradient, "‹" back = exit, title = username/caption);
  center play/pause indicator; bottom bar (gradient + centered action row);
  left/right edge blockers (swallow stray taps so invisible portrait UI
  below can't react); a full-size transparent TAP-SPY.
- `TTrueReelTouch` (tap-spy): OnTouchListener that observes but NEVER
  consumes (returns false) — taps and swipes fall through to Instagram's
  real gesture pipeline, so tap-to-pause, double-tap-to-like and
  swipe-to-page all keep working natively. On a clean single tap it toggles
  our optimistic pause indicator (`A2N`, with a 280ms double-tap revert).
- `A2H/A2J` adopt/restore: DFS for the largest TextureView under the
  fragment view (same `A21` the pill uses), save parent/index/LayoutParams,
  insert at overlay index 0 with MATCH_PARENT. Restore on exit/swap, with
  dead-parent tolerance (fragment view destroyed mid-landscape).
- `A2K` landscape tick (500ms via `TTrueReelTick` + on every recheck
  layout): re-asserts the video LayoutParams (7ky's posted 25n runnables
  clobber them when its own size changes); one-shot `isAvailable()` sanity
  check at ~600ms (falls back to portrait if the surface never
  materialized); PAGE-CHANGE DETECTION by video identity — a new laid-out
  TextureView visible under the fragment view (center within 30% of window
  center, offscreen preloads excluded) means the user swiped: landscape
  video -> swap the adoptee + refresh title/rail; portrait video -> clean
  auto-exit. Debounced across sightings AND across time (350ms anti-mid-
  swipe guard). The v0.9.1 measurement-based auto-exit is GONE.
- `A2M/A2Mv` rail finder: IgSimpleImageView icons (40-220px) centered in
  the right 20% of the fragment, DFS order -> like/comment/share targets.
- `A2P` synthetic tap: MotionEvent.obtain(JJIFFI) DOWN+UP at the view
  center + performClick fallback. Works on hidden views.
- `A2Q/A2R/A2S` action row: like stays in landscape (heart flashes red
  700ms); comment/share exit to portrait first (their sheets are portrait
  bottom sheets that would open BEHIND the overlay) then tap the real
  buttons after 400ms (`TTrueReelTap`).
- `A2L/A2Lv` title finder: deepest non-blank TextView in the bottom-left
  quadrant (username/caption), fallback "Reels".
- `A26/A27` rewritten exits: stop tick, restore video, remove overlay,
  portrait, strip visible, engine re-run, full field cleanup.

## The Android 16+ crash (crash_report_2026-09-19_21-22-18.txt) — FIXED

`java.lang.VerifyError: Verifier rejected class X.TTrueReelHelper: A1E...
[0x56] 'this' argument 'Reference: android.view.View' not instance of
'Unresolved Reference: android.lang.Object'` — the hand-written null-check
idiom in A1E called `Landroid/lang/Object;->getClass()`. `android.lang.Object`
does not exist (it's `java.lang.Object`); Android <= 14 soft-fails unresolved
references (the error was swallowed by A1E's try/catch — which is why Android
10 worked), but Android 16's (SDK 36) stricter verifier hard-rejects the whole
class at load time -> crash at app open (our 6mW.A00 orientation gate loads
the helper at launch). Fixed to `Ljava/lang/Object;->getClass()` and the
entire helper audited for unresolved class references (all 45 distinct
external class refs verified real).

## Local validation performed (against the FULL 177k-file base decode)

- All 8 helper classes assemble clean (smali 2.5.2 --api 29)
- Full patcher run: **189/189 checks pass**, exit 0, idempotent re-run ok
- All 9 patched target files (9Wz, AFt, 6mW, 1fC, 1fI, 0bI, 0bQ, 2Iv, 2ZS)
  assemble together with the helpers into a single test dex

## Expected on-device (v0.10)

Tap "Full screen" on a landscape reel -> rotation -> video fills the screen
edge-to-edge, TikTok chrome on top; tap video = pause (big play icon),
double-tap = like, swipe = next reel (swap if landscape, clean exit if
portrait), back arrow / leaving Reels = portrait restored. Toast:
"InstaTrueReel v0.10.0: fullscreen ON".

## Next (Phase 10 candidates — after v0.10 field test)

1. **SEEKBAR + TIMESTAMPS (the last missing TikTok chrome piece)**. The
   player control surface is mapped but not yet wired: reels playback runs
   on Facebook's HeroPlayer — wrapper `X/1c8` (constructed with
   HeroPlayerSetting; playback registry `X/3dN.EeD/Eu1` keyed on the 7ky
   view via `X/7js`), state machine `X/1cN` with:
   - position: `1cN.A0N()J` (live-computed ms)
   - duration: `1cN.A0O()J` (from state snapshot `X/0X7.A0I`)
   - seek: `1cN.A04(1cN, seekMs, jumpSeek, preview)V`
   - (feed-style scrubber UI exists: com.instagram.ui.mediaactions.
     VideoScrubberSeekBar + controller X/3HF, but that is the FEED player,
     not reels)
   Remaining work: find the runtime chain page -> 1c8/1cN (likely through
   the mci attachment layer: 7js.A00 -> 0HJ/DAK.A06), or hook a state-update
   call site (1cN.A01 processes player Messages) to capture position/
   duration continuously, then add a SeekBar row to the A2G bottom bar.
2. **Pause-state accuracy**: our indicator is optimistic (mirrors our own
   taps). A hook on the real pause path would make it exact — the gesture
   chain is GestureManagerFrameLayout.dispatchTouchEvent -> X/2FQ gesture
   manager -> listener interface (X/1od subclass family); the final player
   call was not yet located. Alternative: 3EO.getMuteOrPauseIconImageView
   visibility polling.
3. **Landscape-anchored comment/share sheets** (stay in landscape instead
   of exiting): reparent the opened bottom sheet into our overlay when it
   attaches.
4. **Reels lag investigation** (user-reported, unrelated to fullscreen):
   4K feed videos vs patch overhead — profile with `adb shell dumpsys
   gfxinfo com.instagram.android` while scrolling reels.
